Customer first: Ensured inter-die parallelism needs are mapped into the TP development strategy and aligns with the Meteor Lake project PHI and CRO targets. 
Fearless innovation: Jonathan is constantly looking for opportunity to innovate as he did with Mock up Lake to validate disag levels pre-silicon","Fearless innovation: Jonathan is constantly challenging the status quo and if he believes there are extra ways to improve TP quality & reliability by creating innovating methods, he will pursuit such developments. He is currently looking into auto generation of pindef using design generated source files for FTR Pindef. 
One Intel Jonathan must continue to work seamlessly across teams & TP stake holders to streamline usage models for parallel test and new disag Class test methodologies."
Q2 2022 Insights,FINAL,Shilpa Rameshchander (10664370),On-Track,"Worked with TPI to deliver robust Disag PLT and levels validation in pre-Si which led to zero-error Base PLT/Power Up-Down/Disag connectivity testing/RunTime Errors (bin98s) during MTL PO Base TP allowing content teams to start content bring up in less than two hours.
